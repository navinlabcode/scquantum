Description: Given bincount data from single-cell copy number profiling (segmented or unsegmented), estimates ploidy, and uses the ploidy estimate to scale the data to absolute copy numbers. Uses the modular quantogram proposed by Kendall (1986) <doi:10.1002/0471667196.ess2129.pub2>, modified by weighting segments according to confidence, and quantifying confidence in the estimate using a theoretical quantogram.
